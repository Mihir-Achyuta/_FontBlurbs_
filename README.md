# FontBlurbs

- This project is an app to easily choose font pairings and save them for future use.

- The user gets to view font pairings with the help of a landing page or a plain text viewer
    - Once a pairing(blurb) has been selected, the user can view it later in their dashboard

## Usage

- The project is currently being converted from EJS to Next.js and will be released in the near future publicly online via Vercel!

## Tech Stack

-  The web application is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses its built in Pages and API features with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store blurb data.

- Email/password and Google OAuth authentication is implemented with [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) and passwords are hashed with [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

- Application currently deployed privately on Vercel and connects to a [MongoDB Atlas Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Future Plans

- ⬜️ Convert EJS client and Node server code to Next.js (ongoing)

- ⬜️ Allow users to organize their blurbs and change/delete names or fonts as needed
