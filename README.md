# FontBlurbs

- This project is an app to easily choose font pairings and save them for future use.

- The user gets to view font pairings with the help of a landing page or a plain text viewer
    - Once a pairing(blurb) has been selected, the user can view it later in their dashboard

## Usage

- The project is currently being converted from EJS to Next.js and will be released in the near future publicly online via Vercel!

## Tech Stack

-  The web application is built with Next.js and TypeScript and uses its built in Pages and API features with MongoDB to store blurb data.

- Email/password and Google OAuth authentication is implemented with Passportjs and passwords are hashed with bcrypt

- Application currently deployed privately on Vercel and connects to a MongoDB Atlas Cluster

## Future Plans

- ⬜️ Convert EJS client and Node server code to Next.js (ongoing)

- ⬜️ Allow users to organize their blurbs and change/delete names or fonts as needed
